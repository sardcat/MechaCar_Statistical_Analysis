## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* In analysing the multiple linear regression model for the Mechacar prototype: vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to MPG. In other words the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon.
* All variables of the analysis: vehcile length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and AWD all had non-zero coefficients, giving a non-zero slope to the model overall.
* In totality, the multiple r-squared value of 0.71 couple with only two signifigant variables (vehicle length & ground clearance) gives evidence of the model overfitting.
