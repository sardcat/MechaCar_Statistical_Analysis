# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
Statistical Analysis with R

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Independant Variable: MPG; Dependant Variables: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and AWD.
* In analysing the multiple linear regression model for the Mechacar prototypes: vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to MPG. In other words the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon.
* All dependant variables in the analysis had non-zero coefficients, giving a non-zero slope to the model overall.
* In totality, the multiple r-squared value of 0.71 coupled with only two signifigant variables (vehicle length & ground clearance) gives evidence of the model overfitting.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.
